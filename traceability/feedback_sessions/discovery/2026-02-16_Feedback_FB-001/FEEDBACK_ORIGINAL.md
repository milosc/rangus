## Feedback Content

I am uncertain why there are no Interview analysis being done. Please create these as part of the Discovery Stage.

## Context

The Discovery analysis for the Ragus system has processed 5 interview transcripts from `Client_Materials/Interviews/`:
1. Session_1.1_The_Clinical_Workflow.md
2. Session_1.2_The_Privacy___Compliance_Barrier.md_
3. Session_1.3_Infrastrucrture_and_Interoperability.md
4. Session_2.1_Cross-Check___Validation.md
5. Session_2.1._Security___Operations_Finalization.md

These interviews have been analyzed to extract client facts (59 total), pain points (14 total), and user types (8 roles), but no dedicated per-interview analysis artifacts were generated in the Discovery output structure.

## Expected Outcome

Create individual interview analysis documents in the Discovery output folder (`ClientAnalysis_Ragus/01-analysis/interviews/`) with structured analysis for each interview session, following the Discovery_Interview_Analyst agent pattern.
