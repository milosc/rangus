## Background

Maria is a 34-year-old office worker experiencing severe abdominal pain. This is her first visit to an emergency room, and she's anxious, in pain, and uncertain about how long she'll have to wait. She arrived at the ER with her husband, checked in at the Intake Desk, and was given a slip of paper with her ID: "MG-16" (her initials plus today's date, December 16th).

Maria is sitting in the waiting room with dozens of other patients, all staring at the large TV display mounted on the wall. She's trying to find her ID on the screen to understand her position in the queue and estimate how long she'll wait before seeing a doctor. She's worried that if she misses her name being called, she'll lose her place in line.

Maria represents the typical ER patient experience: anxiety about wait times, pain or discomfort, confusion about the process, and a desperate need for information and reassurance. She's not a healthcare professional - she just wants to know when she'll be seen and that she hasn't been forgotten.

## A Day in Maria's Life

**10:30 AM** - Maria experiences sharp abdominal pain at work. After 30 minutes, pain doesn't subside. She decides to go to ER.

**11:15 AM** - Maria arrives at ER with husband. Checks in at Intake Desk. Nurse (Jenny) asks for name, birthdate, chief complaint ("severe abdominal pain"), allergies. Jenny hands Maria a slip of paper: **"Your ID is MG-16. Watch the board for your ID."**

**11:20 AM** - Maria sits in waiting room, clutching paper slip with "MG-16" written on it. She scans the TV display, finds her ID under "Waiting for Triage" section. Display shows: **"MG-16 - Waiting for Triage"**. No wait time shown, just status. She feels relieved to see her ID on the board - at least she's in the system.

**11:35 AM** - Maria's ID moves to "Triage In Progress". She's called to triage bay. Nurse (Carol) takes vitals, asks more detailed questions about pain location and severity. Maria returns to waiting room.

**11:45 AM** - Maria checks board again. Her ID now shows: **"MG-16 - Waiting 60 Minutes"**. She understands this means she's in the "approximately 60 minute wait" category. She texts her husband (who went to get coffee): "They said about an hour."

**12:30 PM** - 45 minutes have passed. Maria checks board. Still shows **"MG-16 - Waiting 60 Minutes"**. She's confused - does this mean she has 60 minutes left, or has it been 60 minutes since she checked in? She wishes the board explained the categories more clearly.

**01:15 PM** - Maria's ID suddenly changes to **"MG-16 - Waiting 30 Minutes"**. She feels a surge of relief - she's moving up in priority! She knows she'll be seen soon.

**01:40 PM** - Maria's ID disappears from the board. She panics momentarily, then sees nurse approaching. **"Maria Gonzalez? Follow me."** She's being taken to see the doctor. Her anxiety was warranted - she was watching the right display, and she didn't miss her turn.

**02:30 PM** - Maria receives diagnosis (kidney stone), pain management plan, and discharge instructions. She leaves ER feeling relieved that the system worked, but reflects on how stressful the waiting experience was - constantly watching the board, unsure if the time categories were accurate, anxious about missing her turn.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Know their position in queue** - Understand where they are in the waiting order and that they haven't been forgotten
2. **Understand expected wait time** - Have realistic expectations about how long they'll wait before seeing a doctor
3. **Feel humanized and respected** - Avoid feeling like a number or "cattle" in a processing system
4. **Avoid anxiety and confusion** - Clear, understandable display information that reduces stress rather than increasing it

### Secondary Goals
- Recognize their anonymized ID (Initials + Day format) easily
- Know when to pay attention to the board (when their status changes)
- Understand what each status category means ("Waiting for Triage" vs. "Waiting 60 Minutes")
- Feel confident they won't miss their turn if they step away briefly (bathroom, coffee)

## Pain Points (Linked to Registry)

| Pain Point ID | Description | Impact on Maria |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| PP-2.2 | Patient anxiety with numeric-only identification | If Maria was given only a ticket number (e.g., "287"), she'd struggle to remember it, might lose the paper slip, and would feel dehumanized by the impersonal system |
| PP-4.2 | Aggressive bright public displays at night | If Maria were in the ER at 3 AM, the bright white TV display would add sensory discomfort to her pain and anxiety |
| PP-5.1 | Countdown timers cause patient riots | If the board showed "59:58... 59:57... 59:56..." Maria would fixate on the timer, become increasingly anxious as it approached zero, and would confront staff if the countdown reached zero without being called |

## Frustrations

> "I keep checking the board every 2 minutes. I'm afraid if I look away or go to the bathroom, I'll miss my name and lose my spot. The anxiety is almost worse than the pain."

> "The board says 'Waiting 60 Minutes' but I don't know if that means I have 60 minutes left or if I've been waiting for 60 minutes. It's confusing."

> "They gave me a slip of paper with 'MG-16' on it. I'm relieved it's my initials and not just a random number - at least I can remember it. But I still feel like I'm being tracked like a package."

---

## Motivations

- **Pain Relief**: Maria's primary motivation is getting medical attention and relief from her abdominal pain.
- **Information Need**: She craves information - where is she in the queue, how long will she wait, has she been forgotten?
- **Anxiety Management**: Maria wants the waiting experience to reduce her anxiety, not amplify it. Clear communication and predictable processes help her feel in control.
- **Dignity and Respect**: She wants to feel like a person with a medical emergency, not a number in a system.

## Technology Profile

| Aspect | Current | Desired |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Device | Waiting room TV display (passive viewing) | Same, with clearer explanations of categories |
| Interface | ID + status category display | ID + status + helpful context (e.g., "Waiting 60 min = approximate wait time") |
| Training | None - must be immediately understandable | Zero training - self-explanatory display |
| Customization | None | Optional SMS/app notifications when status changes |

### Technology Attitudes
- **Positive**: "I like that my ID uses my initials - I can remember 'MG-16' way easier than '287'. It feels a little more human."
- **Skeptical**: "I don't know if I trust the wait time categories. What if they're wrong? What if I've been forgotten?"
- **Pragmatic**: "I just want to know: Am I still in line? When will I be seen? That's all I need."

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Recognizing Privacy-Compliant ID
**Current Experience**: Maria is given ticket number "287". She tries to memorize it, but after 20 minutes can't remember if it was "287" or "278". She checks paper slip repeatedly, anxious about losing it. Feels dehumanized by the impersonal number.

**Desired Experience**: Maria is given ID "MG-16" (her initials + day). She immediately recognizes it as her own, doesn't need to check paper slip constantly. Feels like the system acknowledges her as a person, not just a number.

### Scenario 2: Understanding Wait Time Categories
**Current Experience**: Maria sees "Waiting 60 Minutes" on board. She doesn't know if this means she has 60 minutes left, or if 60 minutes have already passed, or if it's an estimate. She asks staff for clarification, but they're too busy to explain. Anxiety increases.

**Desired Experience**: Board displays: **"MG-16 - Waiting Time: ~60 min (approximate)"** with subtle explanatory text at bottom of screen: *"Wait times are estimates assigned by doctor. Actual time may vary based on urgent cases."* Maria understands the category immediately, feels informed.

### Scenario 3: Avoiding Countdown Timer Anxiety
**Current Experience** (hypothetical): Board shows countdown timer: **"MG-16 - Time Remaining: 59:58"**. Maria fixates on timer, watching it tick down. At 00:05, she starts walking toward intake desk. At 00:00, she knocks on glass demanding to see doctor. Timer created confrontational behavior.

**Desired Experience**: Board shows category-based display: **"MG-16 - Waiting Time: ~60 min"**. No countdown. Maria checks board periodically, remains calm. When her status changes to "Waiting 30 min", she knows she's moving up in priority. No confrontational behavior.

## Design Implications

### Display Requirements
- **Large, readable fonts** - Visible from 20+ feet away in waiting room
- **Privacy-compliant IDs** - Initials + Day format (MG-16), maximum 8 characters
- **Category-based wait times** - "Waiting 30 min", "Waiting 60 min" (NO countdown timers)
- **Clear status messages** - "Waiting for Triage", "Waiting for Doctor", "With Doctor"
- **Explanatory footer** - Subtle text explaining that wait times are estimates

### Usability Requirements
- **No medical details** - No complaints, vitals, or diagnoses shown (GDPR/HIPAA compliance)
- **Color-blind accessible** - Icons + text, not color alone for status changes
- **Dark mode option** - For late-night waiting room comfort (reduce sensory overload)
- **Highlighted updates** - Brief highlight or blink when patient's status changes (so they notice)

### Communication Requirements
- **Clear categorization** - Immediate, 30min, 60min, 120min, Rest categories with descriptions
- **No false precision** - Avoid countdown timers that create anxiety and confrontations
- **Reassurance messaging** - Subtle messages like "You will be notified when it's your turn" to reduce anxiety
- **Multilingual support** (optional) - Spanish, other languages for diverse patient population

## Quotes from Interviews

*From Session_1.2_The_Privacy___Compliance_Barrier.md:*

> "Patient Rights Rep (Linda): Patients with just ticket numbers often forget them or lose the paper slips. Initials + day format is much more memorable and feels more humanized."

> "GDPR Lead: We tested countdown timers in a pilot. Patients fixated on them, became extremely anxious, and confronted staff when the timer reached zero without being called. We had to remove them."

*From Session_2.1_Cross-Check___Validation.md:*

> "Patient Rights Rep: Patients describe the waiting experience as feeling 'like cattle'. They want to know they haven't been forgotten, that they're moving through the process, and that they'll be seen soon."
