## Background

Carol has been the Head Nurse at the ER for 10 years, with 20 years of total emergency nursing experience. She's the critical link between intake and doctor evaluation - responsible for taking vitals, assigning initial ESI scores, and preparing patients for medical review. Carol is also the "workflow coordinator," ensuring that patients don't get stuck in bottlenecks between intake and triage.

She works rotating shifts, including nights, where she struggles with bright white screens that hurt her eyes after hours of staring. Carol is highly skilled at reading patients - she knows when someone's vital signs look stable on paper but their behavior or appearance suggests something more serious. She adds detailed clinical notes for doctors, documenting observations that aren't captured by blood pressure cuffs or thermometers.

Carol's biggest challenge is managing float staff during vacation coverage or sick days. When temporary nurses cover triage, they often struggle with complex systems that require extensive training. She needs tools that are intuitive enough for someone to sit down and use effectively within 30 seconds - no manuals, no training sessions.

## A Day in Carol's Life

**06:30 AM** - Carol arrives for the day shift, reviews overnight patient backlog. She logs into the triage system and sees 5 patients waiting from intake. She prioritizes based on chief complaints.

**07:00 AM** - First patient: 28-year-old with severe abdominal pain. Carol takes vitals (BP 140/90, HR 98, O2 98%, Temp 99.1°F), assigns initial ESI level 3, adds clinical note: "Patient grimacing, guarding abdomen, appears in significant distress." Marks patient as "Triage Complete" and moves to next.

**09:30 AM** - Workflow bottleneck: 10+ patients waiting between intake and triage. Carol works through queue methodically, but triage process takes 5-7 minutes per patient with current system. Patients in waiting room are getting restless.

**12:45 PM** - Night shift coverage tonight - Carol knows she'll be staring at bright white screens for 8 hours. She wishes the system had dark mode like her phone does.

**03:00 PM** - Emergency escalation: Patient waiting 90 minutes shows behavioral changes (confusion, slurred speech). Carol flags patient for immediate doctor review, updating ESI to level 2. Clinical judgment caught something the automated system would have missed.

**06:00 PM** - Shift change to night coverage. Carol continues triage duties under dimmer lighting. Bright white screens are already causing eye strain. She reduces screen brightness manually, which helps slightly but makes text harder to read.

**02:30 AM** - Float nurse covering break asks Carol how to assign ESI levels and where to enter clinical notes. Carol provides quick 2-minute walkthrough, but float nurse still makes 1 navigation error during first hour.

**06:30 AM** - End of night shift. Carol processed 63 patients during 12-hour shift. Eyes are fatigued from bright screens. She's relieved to see daylight again.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Complete triage efficiently without bottlenecks** - Process patients quickly (target 5 minutes per patient) to prevent waiting room backlog
2. **Provide accurate clinical context to doctors** - Document behavioral observations, concerns, and vital signs that inform treatment decisions
3. **Work effectively during night shifts** - Reduce eye strain and fatigue from bright screens during overnight coverage
4. **Enable float staff to work without training** - System must be intuitive enough for temporary staff to use effectively within 30 seconds

### Secondary Goals
- Catch escalating conditions through clinical observation (profuse sweating, behavioral changes)
- Act as doctor proxy in emergency situations when physician is unavailable
- Maintain workflow coordination between intake and doctor evaluation
- Work efficiently with gloved or sanitized hands

## Pain Points (Linked to Registry)

| Pain Point ID | Description | Impact on Carol |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| PP-1.2 | Waiting room bottleneck between intake and triage | Creates patient anxiety and dissatisfaction; Carol feels pressured to speed through triage, potentially missing critical observations |
| PP-1.3 | Poor UX for gloved/sanitized hands | Forces Carol to remove gloves frequently to interact with small UI elements, slowing workflow and creating infection control issues |
| PP-4.1 | Bright screens hurt night shift staff | Causes severe eye strain during 12-hour night shifts, leading to fatigue and reduced efficiency |
| PP-4.3 | Zero training time requirement for float staff | When float nurses cover shifts, they struggle with complex interfaces, requiring Carol's time to train them or leading to workflow errors |

## Frustrations

> "There's a 10-minute wait between intake and triage on a good day. Patients are anxious, families are asking questions, and I'm moving as fast as I can. The system should help me go faster, not slow me down."

> "Working night shifts with these bright white screens is brutal. After 8 hours, my eyes are burning. Everyone has dark mode on their phones - why don't clinical systems?"

> "When regular staff are on vacation and float nurses cover, there's no time for training. If the system isn't self-explanatory in 30 seconds, they're going to skip features or make mistakes."

> "I'm constantly wearing gloves or have just sanitized my hands. Clicking tiny checkboxes and text links is frustrating. Everything should be big and obvious."

---

## Motivations

- **Patient-Centered Care**: Carol is driven by ensuring every patient receives timely, accurate triage. She takes pride in her ability to spot clinical changes before automated systems would flag them.
- **Workflow Efficiency**: She wants to eliminate bottlenecks that cause patient anxiety and staff stress.
- **Team Leadership**: As Head Nurse, Carol feels responsible for ensuring float staff can perform effectively without extensive training.
- **Health and Well-being**: After 20 years in nursing, Carol is aware of occupational health issues like eye strain and wants tools that support her long-term well-being.

## Technology Profile

| Aspect | Current | Desired |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Device | Desktop touchscreen (20" monitor) | Same, but with glove-friendly UI and dark mode |
| Interface | Bright white screens, small text fields | Dark mode option, large touch targets, minimal typing |
| Training | 3-hour formal training for new staff | Zero training - intuitive within 30 seconds |
| Customization | None | Dark/light mode toggle, preset clinical note templates |

### Technology Attitudes
- **Positive**: "I like systems that let me focus on the patient, not the screen. Big buttons, fast forms, and clear visual cues."
- **Skeptical**: "Most systems are designed for daytime office workers, not ER nurses working 12-hour night shifts with gloves on."
- **Pragmatic**: "If it saves me 2 minutes per patient, that's 2 hours per shift I can spend on actual patient care instead of clicking through forms."

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Night Shift Triage
**Current Experience**: Carol works 12-hour night shift (6 PM - 6 AM) staring at bright white screens. By 2 AM, her eyes are burning. She reduces screen brightness, which helps slightly but makes small text harder to read. By end of shift, she has significant eye fatigue.

**Desired Experience**: Carol logs in for night shift and activates dark mode with a single toggle. Screen displays dark background with high-contrast text. Her eyes feel comfortable throughout the shift, and she maintains efficiency without adjusting brightness manually.

### Scenario 2: Float Nurse Coverage
**Current Experience**: Float nurse covering Carol's break asks for training on ESI assignment and clinical notes entry. Carol spends 5 minutes explaining navigation, but float nurse still makes 2 errors during first hour (wrong screen, missed note field). Carol has to correct entries later.

**Desired Experience**: Float nurse sits down at triage workstation. Interface shows large labeled sections: "VITALS", "ESI LEVEL", "CLINICAL NOTES". All actions are self-explanatory with visual cues. Float nurse completes triage without errors or questions.

### Scenario 3: Triage Workflow Bottleneck
**Current Experience**: Carol processes 10 patients in 70 minutes (7 minutes each) due to slow form navigation, small text fields, and multi-screen workflow. Patients in waiting room experience 10+ minute delays.

**Desired Experience**: Carol processes 10 patients in 50 minutes (5 minutes each) using streamlined single-screen triage form with large touch targets, preset templates for common observations, and auto-save functionality. Waiting room delays reduced to <5 minutes.

## Design Implications

### Mobile UI Requirements
- **Dark mode toggle** - Essential for night shift staff to reduce eye strain
- **Touch targets MUST be 44x44px minimum** - Accommodate gloved hands
- **High-contrast color schemes** - Both light and dark modes must have strong contrast
- **Large, clear fonts** - Readable without squinting during 12-hour shifts
- **Single-screen triage form** - No multi-page wizards

### Workflow Requirements
- **Streamlined vitals entry** - Quick numeric keypad for BP, HR, O2, Temp with large buttons
- **ESI level selection** - Visual scale (1-5) with color coding and descriptions
- **Clinical notes templates** - Preset phrases for common observations ("Patient grimacing", "Appears anxious", "Profuse sweating")
- **Auto-save on field change** - No manual "Save" button required
- **Visual workflow state indicators** - Clear status of where patient is in triage process

### Training Requirements
- **Zero formal training** - System must be self-explanatory within 30 seconds
- **Contextual tooltips** - Inline help for ESI guidelines without leaving screen
- **Consistent layout** - Same button positions across all triage screens
- **Visual cues for required fields** - Color coding or icons to show what's needed

## Quotes from Interviews

*From Session_1.1_The_Clinical_Workflow.md:*

> "Observation: There's a significant wait time (10+ minutes) between intake completion and being called to triage. // Carol: That's our biggest bottleneck right now."

*From Session_2.1_Cross-Check___Validation.md:*

> "Question: What happens when regular staff are on vacation and float nurses cover? // Carol: There's zero time for training. If they can't figure out the system in 30 seconds, they're going to struggle the whole shift."

> "Question: How do you handle night shifts with bright screens? // Carol: I reduce the brightness, but it's not ideal. Bright white screens at 3 AM are brutal."
